# Panel-Data-Modelling-
Panel Model of International Trade for West African Region  
Preliminary analysis was carried out on the panel data in order to inspect the behavior of the data; also panel unit root was conducted in the project to ascertain stationary properties in the variables over the period of time considered before fitting the model. The task adopt Pooled OLS, Fixed Effect Model, and Random Effect Model to fit the panel regression model for the panel data sets, F-test was use to select between Pooled OLS model and Fixed effect model, Breush-Pagan LM test was use to known the best model between Pooled OLS and Random effect model, and finally Hausman specification test was used to decide between fixed effect model and random effect model. The study shows that fixed effect model is accurate for the study, and also GDP and FDI have positive significant impact on the international trade. Hence, the task recommends provision of a peaceful economic and political environment needed for local and foreign investors.
